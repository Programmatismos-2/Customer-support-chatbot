Air carrier’s responsibility


The term “damage” includes death, injury, delay, partial or total loss or any other damage resulting from the transportation or any other related services performed by the Carrier.

Our liability as a Carrier is determined in accordance with the provisions of the Convention as implemented by Regulation (EC) under No. 889/2002 and the national legislation in force. We are not responsible for any damage due to our compliance with applicable law or state rules or regulations. Any responsibility we bear for compensation shall be limited due to your own negligence that may have caused, contributed to or increased the damage in accordance with the applicable law.

As a Carrier, we are liable only for damages incurred during the transportation in flights or parts of flights on the ticket of which our Airline Code appears.

Regardless of what is specified in the transportation contract or other applicable law: (a) The Carrier is not liable for damage to a passenger or baggage not handed over to the “check-in counter” and registered by the Carrier, unless this damage was caused due to the Carrier’s negligence. (b) The Carrier is not liable for any damage arising directly and exclusively from the faithful application of laws, state regulations, provisions or rules or non-compliance by the passenger. (c) Any carrier’s exclusion or limitation of liability in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall also apply to the Carrier’s agents, employees or representatives as well as to anyone whose aircraft is used by the Carrier for carriage and to its agents, employees or representatives.
